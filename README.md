# Naver Trending

## About
Creates a .txt file with the current top 10 trending searches on Naver, Korea's most popular search engine.

## How to
Terminal will also show the same view as you would see if you opened the .txt file, except the names are abbreviated to just two characters (%2) to save space.

If you want to track this data for longer or alter the refresh rate (default: 5000ms) of the program, feel free to alter the `public static final int` values at the top of the document.

Please make sure to change the address to which the .txt log file is being saved to. The program will **not** run on the current, custom file path.
